APPROACH
********
For this project I wanted to create a game that could be hosted and shared as an educational tool for Lynnhaven River Now (LRN). LRN is a nonprofit organization that works to restore and protect local waterways in my hometown of Hampton Roads. The information in this trivia-style quiz is geared specifically toward LRN's Pearl Home program, which grants special certification to households that can meet at least 15 of the sustainability practices listed in a form checklist. Outside of that form though, LRN was lacking a dynamic/fun way to share these recommended practices online, so I created this game for Hampton Roads residents of all ages who may be interested in sustainability. The content was adapted from the bullet-style form hosted on LRN's website; I then categorized them, rewrote them as true/false-style statements, and prompted the user to test their knowledge by choosing the correct statement. Each question is followed with an explanation page, to make sure the experience is educational.

TECHNOLOGIES USED

USER STORIES
************
• As a user, I want the brand identity of the parent organization for this application to be easily identifiable, so that I can trust where the information is coming from and understand their motivations.

• As a user, I want the questions and answers to be easy enough for a child to understand, so that I can get my whole household involved in the learning experience.

• As a user, I want to see an automatic followup explanation after each question so that I can learn more about why my answer is right or wrong.

• As a user, I don’t want the answers to be too obvious or predictable, so that the quiz will be interesting and fun.

• As a user, I want a button to get from the explanation screen to the next question, so that I can read at my own pace and continue the quiz when I’m ready.

• As a user, I want to see my score updated throughout so that I can keep track of my progress.

• As a user, I want to see my final score at the end of the quiz so that I can have a better sense of how well I did overall.

• As a user, I want an easy way to share the quiz with my friends and family after I’m done so that they can learn what I learned.

• As a user, I want an easy way to apply for the Pearl Home certification, so that I can make my sustainability commitment official.

UNSOLVED PROBLEMS / FOLLOWUP GOALS
**********************************
With more time to revisit the project, I would like to refine the media queries, write more content for more quiz questions, and use this project as a template to build out additional quizzes for each of LRN's sustainability certification programs: Pearl Schools, Pearl Faith, Pearl Business.
